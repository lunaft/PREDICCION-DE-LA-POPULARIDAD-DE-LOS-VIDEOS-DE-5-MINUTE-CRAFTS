# Predicting Success on YouTube
This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised modeling to predict the success of videos on YouTube before they are published. It is based on analyzing video titles from the "5-Minute Crafts" channel to find patterns that can be correlated with video popularity.

# Project Description
The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can help content creators identify which videos have the potential to go viral before they are published. To do this, natural language processing techniques are used to analyze video titles and supervised models are used to make the predictions.

### How the project works
### Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is performed, including tokenization of video titles and transformation of words into numeric vectors.

### Supervised Models: Supervised models, such as linear regression and Ridge Regression, are trained using features derived from video titles to predict their popularity.

### Neural Networks: In addition to supervised models, a neural network is used to make predictions based on the preprocessed data. The neural network learns from the patterns present in the video titles and correlations with their popularity.
